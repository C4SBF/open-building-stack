# Open Building Stack Working Group

The goal of this working group is to create and promote software which will facilitate connections to legacy building machines, equipment and systems that speak legacy protocols such as Modbus, BACnet, and LON and enable the data and control points on those machines and systems to be ingested and delivered to local and cloud based systems and computers.
